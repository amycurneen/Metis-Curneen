# Targeting New York Subway Stations for Tech Gala Success

### Project 1 at Metis

Using information from the New York Transit system, we determined which stations Women Tech Women Yes should place their volunteers at to get the highest email sign-ups. We also factored in data that located where tech-hubs are and where New Yorkâ€™s most philanthropic companies are located. I encourage you to review my teams presentation and our Jupyter Notebooks to dive deeper into this project.
