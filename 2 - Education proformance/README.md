# How Social Factors Affect a State's School Rank

### Project 2 at Metis
#### Regression - Supervised learning on continuous data

Using information I scraped from the web, I built linear regression models from which I learned about the state of the Education system in America. I analyzed  many factors through this project ranging from incarceration rate to state education budget. By using ElasticNetCV, I determined that the most important factor are Incarceration rate, quality of healthcare and the poverty level in each respective State. I encourage you to review my presentation and Jupyter Notebooks to dive deeper into this project.
